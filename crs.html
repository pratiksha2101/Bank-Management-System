<p><h3>A. Introduction</h3></p>
<p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a long-standing commitment at LENI DENI Bank and
forms an integral part of our activities. The Bank’s contribution to social sector development
includes several pioneering interventions, and is implemented through the involvement of
stakeholders within the Bank and the broader community. The Bank established the LENI DENI
Foundation for Inclusive Growth (LENI DENI Foundation) in 2008 with a view to significantly expand the
activities in the area of CSR. Over the last few years LENI DENI Foundation has developed significant
projects in specific areas, and has built capabilities for direct project implementation as opposed
to extending financial support to other organisations.
The objective of the Bank is to pro-actively support meaningful socio-economic development in
India and enable a larger number of people to participate in and benefit from India’s economic
progress. This is based on the belief that growth and development are effective only when they
result in wider access to opportunities and benefit a broader section of society. The aim is to
identify critical areas of development that require investments and intervention, and which can
help to realise India’s potential for growth and prosperity.

<p><h3>G. Corporate Social Responsibility Activities</h3></p>
<p>The CSR Committee of the Bank would consider and approve the projects or programmes that</p>
<p>the Bank should undertake as CSR in India.</p>
<p>The Bank’s primary focus areas for CSR activities are:</p>
<p><h4>1. Education</h4></p>
<p>(Schedule VII (ii) promoting education, including special education and employment enhancing
vocation skills especially among children, women, elderly and the differently abled and livelihood
enhancement projects)</p>

<p>Education represents a critical area of action to realise India’s growth potential as also make it
inclusive, by enabling children from all sections of society to have access to quality basic
education that equips them for taking up higher education or job-oriented skill training. At the
same time, India’s institutions of higher learning also require investment in capacity building to
support India’s growing and evolving needs and become global centres of excellence.
The Bank, both directly and through LENI DENI Foundation, will continue to work with various bodies
including state governments and other not-for-profit organisations to improve the quality of
education in government and municipal schools, which account for the vast majority of schoolgoing
children in the country. LENI DENI Bank will continue to work with institutes of higher education
for focused capacity-building in specified disciplines, particularly finance & management.</p>
<p><h4>2. Health care</h4></p>
<p>(Schedule VII (i) Eradicating hunger, poverty and malnutrition, promoting preventive healthcare
and sanitation and making available safe drinking water; (iii) Promoting gender equality,
empowering women, setting up homes and hostels for women and orphans, setting up old age
homes, day care centres and such other facilities for senior citizens and measures for reducing
inequalities faced by socially and economically backward groups; (x) Rural development projects)
The healthcare challenge in India spans a number of dimensions, including access to affordable
healthcare for the poor; awareness of health issues & available facilities/ benefits among the less
privileged segments of society and specific vulnerable sections of the population; and child
malnutrition, which impairs the capacity of a child to lead a healthy and productive life.
Addressing this challenge is essential to achieve the objective of inclusive growth.
The Bank and LENI DENI Foundation will continue to focus on developing innovative models with the
potential to scale up and bring about improvements in the delivery of healthcare to the
marginalised segments of society and other appropriate measures to promote health care.</p>
<p><h4>3. Skill development and sustainable livelihoods</h4></p>
<p>(Schedule VII (ii) promoting education, including special education and employment enhancing
vocation skills especially among children, women, elderly and the differently abled and livelihood
enhancement projects; (iii) Promoting gender equality, empowering women, setting up homes
and hostels for women and orphans, setting up old age homes, day care centres and such other
facilities for senior citizens and measures for reducing inequalities faced by socially and
economically backward groups)
Enabling India’s youth to gain skills that can provide employment is key to realising the potential
of India’s demographic dividend and driving inclusive growth. Improving employability of the
youth from lower-income sections of society is hence an important focus area. 

The LENI DENI Academy for Skills has been set up across the country to provide job-oriented skill
training to youth. Several centres have been set up across the country. In this initiative, LENI DENI
Foundation is also leveraging the skills and training capabilities of large corporates in developing
training modules in their respective domains. LENI DENI Foundation is also liaising with corporates and
businesses to get the trained youth employed, through a job portal. LENI DENI Bank will continue to
develop the LENI DENI Rural Self Employment Training Institutes.</p>
<p><h4>4. Financial inclusion</h4></p>
<p>(Schedule VII (iii) Promoting gender equality, empowering women, setting up homes and hostels
for women and orphans, setting up old age homes, day care centres and such other facilities for
senior citizens and measures for reducing inequalities faced by socially and economically
backward groups (x) Rural development projects).
The Bank strongly believes that to improve the overall economic condition of the low-income
population and to empower them with means to overcome adversities or inequalities, access to
financial services is an important factor.
The Bank would continue to focus on expanding its reach and its initiatives in this area include
using various channels like branches and business correspondents, and leveraging technology,
to make banking services accessible to low-income groups and the rural population, including
the urban poor and migrant workers.</p>
<p><h4>5. Support employee engagement in CSR activities</h4></p>
<p>The Bank supports the involvement of its employees in CSR activities. The Bank will encourage</p>
employees to participate in CSR activities of the Bank and LENI DENI Foundation.
<p><h4>6. Capacity building for corporate social responsibility</h4></p>
<p>LENI DENI Foundation will continue to promote incubation of expertise for implementing corporate
social responsibility initiatives. It will also work towards providing a platform for organisations
engaged in social initiatives, and discussion & thought leadership on critical challenges to
inclusive growth. The Bank and LENI DENI Foundation will continue to support initiatives that promote
individual and corporate philanthropy.</p>
<p><h4>7. Other areas</h4></p>
<p>LENI DENI Bank will continue to provide support to specific needs such as during natural disasters,
through financial as well as logistical support. The CSR Committee of the Bank may choose to
